In addition to drawing simulated samples from diffusion models
described above <<<or below - wherever you'd like to have this
section, probably somewhere near 3.2 Performance on simulations>>>, we
performed spatially explicit individual-based forward simulations of
selection acting on a beneficially allele using a new simulation
framework  [0].

First, we established a boundary for a single population spread across
a broader geographic region of Europe. In order to ensure a reasonably
uniform distribution of individuals across this spatial range
throughout the course of the forward simulation, we set the maximum
distance for spatial competition and mating choice between individuals
to 250 km, and the standard deviation of the normal distribution
governing the spread of offspring from their parents at 25 km. We note
that we have chosen the values of these parameters to ensure a roughly
uniform spread of individuals across a simulated landscape at
equilibrium [Figure A], and they do not necessarily represent realistic
values of such parameters at a specific time in human history.

After defining the spatial context of the simulations, we introduced a
single beneficial additive mutation in four diffrent starting
locations [Figure B] to study the spread of such allele depending on
the geographic context of its origin. Furthermore, in each of the four
scenarios, we varied the selection coefficient of the beneficial
mutation (0.001, 0.002, ..., 0.005, and 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.05) as well
as the time of its first occurence (20, 15, 10, and 5 thousand years
ago).

Throughout the course of each simulation, between the time of the
introduction of the beneficial allele and the present, we tracked the
position of each individual that ever lived, together with its
location on a two-dimensional map, and its genotype (zero, one, or two
copies of the allele). We then used this complete information about
the spatial distribution of the beneficial allele in each time point
to study the accuracy of our model in infering the parameters of
interest.
